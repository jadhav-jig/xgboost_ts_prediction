# Prediction using Xgboost

Here we are trying to predict the hourly usage of electricity using XGBoost library. 
Our data has a timestamp and usage of electricity in the other column.
We are initially manipulating data and then we are using xgboost library to predict on test data. 
Test data shows good predictions and we have also generated error metrics of the dataset.
